### üìå Overview
---
This project focuses on developing a deep learning-based system to forecast monthly Antarctic glacier coverage using historical satellite imagery. By experimenting with various temporal models, the project aims to enhance the accuracy of glacier distribution predictions, contributing to climate change research and environmental monitoring.  
- Project Duration: April 28, 2025 ‚Äì May 16, 2025
