📌 Overview
=====
This project aims to build and evaluate machine learning pipelines to forecast electricity consumption using real-world data provided by Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO). It integrates multiple regression models, including ensemble techniques like stacking, and incorporates feature importance analysis to enhance interpretability.  
• Project Duration: March 31, 2025 – April 10, 2025   
• Data Source: Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO)  
• Repository: GitHub - somnio-kimm/energy_consumption_analysis  

🧰 Tools and Technologies
=====
• Languages: Python  
• Libraries: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, matplotlib, seaborn  
• Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook, VSCode

🔍 Key Features
=====
1. Data Preprocessing
• Cleaned missing values and removed outliers to improve model quality.  
• Performed feature engineering and normalization to optimize model performance.  
• Implemented safe train-test split pipelines to prevent data leakage.  
2. Model Building
• Built baseline models including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.  
• Applied hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to improve model accuracy.  
• Combined the best-performing models using a stacking ensemble approach.  
3. Evaluation & Interpretability
• Assessed models with metrics like MAE, RMSE, R², and Adjusted R².  
• Conducted residual analysis and visualized feature importances for interpretability.  
• Identified key predictors of energy consumption such as temperature and time-of-day.
